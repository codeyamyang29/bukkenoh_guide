# Bukkenoh Guide

### Introduction & Purpose

This guide is for English employees.<br/>
To minimize confusion when tackling unknown characters in the code and to unify the project structure.

### Backlog Basics
The working task is registered in the backlog. The person in charge is the one who will set the project deadline and the last person to confirm the project completion.

__When Starting__

ðŸ”µ Change the status from " <span style="color:#ED8077; font-weight: bold">Open</span> " to " <span style="color:#4488C5; font-weight: bold">In Progress</span> ".

__When Confirming | Checking__

ðŸŸ¢ Change the status from " <span style="color:#4488C5; font-weight: bold">In Progress</span>" to " <span style="color:#5EB5A6; font-weight: bold">Resolved</span>  "<br/>
ðŸŸ¢ Change the assignee from " yourname " to " person in charge "

If the person in charge finished checking the status will be set to " <span style="color:#A1AF2F; font-weight: bold">Closed</span> "

### Backlog Interface

*   Project Key - The ID for the project. 

*   Wiki - Where the env config can be found.

*   Files - Where the image and the design data is located.

*   Git- Where the source code link is located. You can view your branch changes.

### Coding Basics
When the status in the backlog in change to In Progress. You can start working with the task. Usually the task list will look like below.

```

Project : U0314
|__ Parent Task ( ex. U0314-01 )
    |_ Child Task - Partslist  ( ex. U0314-02 )
    |_ Child Task - Top Page   ( ex. U0314-03 )
    |_ Child Task - Lower Page ( ex. U0314-04 )
    |_ ....
    
```

The " <span style="color:#8FB8DC">U0314-XX</span> " is called the issued key and you will be using this as branch name when creating a new branch. When updating the issude branch it would automatically notify in the issued page in backlog.

- STORE_ID = 124
 
// can be found in the project wiki
+ USER_ID = 123
+ STORE_ID = 123

```

3. In the `<project>/src` run the following command line: __`yarn install`__
